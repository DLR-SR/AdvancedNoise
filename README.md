Noise
=====

An open Library for the Generation of Stochastic Signals in Modelica


## Library description

The Noise library is developed to consistently define an algorithmically random source in Modelica. Care has been taken to develop a source which has a high statistical randomness. This is illustrated in an example. Furthermore, care has been taken to generate a continuous, event-free source to avoid extremely high performance penalties due to integrator restarts.

Potential applications are:
- Sensor Noise
- Stochastical excitations like air gusts and road excitation
