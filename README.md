AdvancedNoise
=====

This library is an extension of the basic noise generation contained in [Modelica_Noise](https://github.com/DLR-SR/Noise).

In addition to the standard random number generation contained in Modelica_Noise, this library provides:
- an event-free noise generator using DIRCS Immediate Random with Continuous Seed
- additional distributions and statistics tool
- smooth interpolation methods for noise sources
- frequency shaping according to given power spectral densities.

Potential applications of the library are
- correct modeling of sensor noise
- unsampled stochastic excitations such as as rail roughness or turbulence
- ...
