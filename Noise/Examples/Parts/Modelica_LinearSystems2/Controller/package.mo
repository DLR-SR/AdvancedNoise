  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This package provides input/output blocks where every
block is available in a <b>continuous</b> and a <b>discrete</b> (sampled)
representation. A block is defined via its <b>continuous
parameterization</b>. By specifying a discretization method and
a sample time, the discrete representation is automatically
derived from the continuous form. The defaults of the most
important options for <b>all blocks</b> are set in the global SampleClock
component (via inner/outer).
As a result, it is, e.g., easy to switch quickly
between a continuous and a discrete representation of all
blocks of a controller.

<p>
Examples to demonstrate the technique are given in the package
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica_LinearSystems2.Controller.Examples\">Examples</a>.
Especially, the continuous or discrete control of a simple flexible
drive with a P-PI cascade controller is demonstrated in example
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica_LinearSystems2.Controller.Examples.SimpleControlledDrive\">SimpleControlledDrive</a>.
